Welcome to the Poker Club HQ help website!

Poker Club HQ is a new app, currently in beta, available on iPhones and iPads, Android phones and tablets, and on the web at https://pokerclubhq.com

Our ultimate goal for the app is to become the headquarters for your Poker club or league — the app you use to plan and run your tournaments, and track your tournament and player stats, for each tournament, and across multiple seasons.

### This beta version supports the following features:

* Creates high quality blind structures for tournaments of any size.
* Supports entry of chip sets with customizable values and colors.
* Supports big blind antes, standard antes, or no antes.
* Blind levels can also be created manually with complete flexibility.
* Includes a full screen timer that maximizes the size of the timer and blind values, and shows upcoming blinds and breaks, the average stack size per player, and estimated tournament end time.

### In the next few months we'll be adding support for:

* Adding players to your tournaments, providing support for seating, and balancing or consolidating tables as players get knocked out.
* Keeping a detailed log of:
  * Player buy-ins, addons, rebuys and reentries.
  * Knockouts and total play time for each player.
* The ability to add custom tournament and player stats you want to track and view in reports, for example player points, etc..
* The ability to view club wide and individual player stats, reports, and graphs compiled from single or multiple tournaments or seasons.
* The ability to securely share your club data to the cloud so it can be managed from multiple devices, with the option for providing read-only access to other club members.

Important note for iPhone and iPad: Installing the beta overwrites our free Texas Holdem Poker Timer app on the device you install it on, and the beta does not yet support importing any of the tournaments or settings you have in the old app. However, the tournaments and settings from the old app are not lost. If you reinstall the latest version of the app from the App Store, over the beta version, your tournaments and other settings will be accessible again. Important: don't delete the beta version, or your tournaments and settings from the old app will be deleted as well.

### We would love your feedback!​
